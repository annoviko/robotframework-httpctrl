Examples
========

Send GET request to obtain origin IP address and check that is not empty:

.. code:: robotframework

    *** Settings ***

    Library         HttpCtrl.Client
    Library         HttpCtrl.Json

    *** Test Cases ***

    Get Origin Address
        Initialize Client   www.httpbin.org
        Send HTTP Request   GET   /ip

        ${response status}=   Get Response Status
        ${response body}=     Get Response Body
        ${response body}=     Decode Bytes To String   ${response body}   UTF-8

        ${expected status}=   Convert To Integer   200
        Should Be Equal   ${response status}   ${expected status}

        ${origin}=    Get Json Value From String   ${response body}   origin
        Should Not Be Empty   ${origin}


In this example HTTP client sends POST request to HTTP server. HTTP server receives it and checks incoming
request for correctness.

.. code:: robotframework

    *** Settings ***

    Library         String
    Library         HttpCtrl.Client
    Library         HttpCtrl.Server

    Test Setup       Initialize HTTP Client And Server
    Test Teardown    Terminate HTTP Server

    *** Test Cases ***

    Receive And Reply To POST
        ${request body}=   Set Variable   { "message": "Hello!" }
        Send HTTP Request Async   POST   /post   ${request body}

        Wait For Request
        Reply By   200

        ${method}=   Get Request Method
        ${url}=      Get Request Url
        ${body}=     Get Request Body
        ${body}=     Decode Bytes To String   ${body}   UTF-8

        Should Be Equal   ${method}   POST
        Should Be Equal   ${url}      /post
        Should Be Equal   ${body}     ${request body}
