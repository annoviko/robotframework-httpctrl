  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
      <b>HttpCtrl</b> is an open source library for <b>Robot Framework</b> that provides HTTP/HTTPS client and HTTP
      server services to make REST API testing easy. The library is written using Python 3 language. The library is
      distributed under The 3-Clause BSD License.
  </p>
  <p>
      The reason why the library was implemented is requirement to use client/server API simultaneously in tests, for
      example, a client sends request to make some procedure on a server and  the client should provide callback to
      obtain result of the procedure. This is a case when server is also required to obtain result and check it.
  </p>
